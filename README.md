prompt> mkdir --parents /etc/apt/keyrings
prompt> curl --fail --location --silent --show-error https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg \
           | gpg --dearmor --output /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg
prompt> echo "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg] \
              https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
              $(lsb_release -cs) stable" \
           | tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list
