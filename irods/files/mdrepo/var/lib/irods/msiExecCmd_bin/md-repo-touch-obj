# Create an empty data object

# Usage: md-repo-touch-obj SVC_ACNT DATA_PATH
#
# SVC_ACNT is the iRODS account used by the MD Repo service. -DATA_PATH is the
# absolute path to the data object that will be created.
#
# This script creates an empty data object so that a person uploading data into
# MD Repo can use an iRODS ticket to create a data object. By creating an empty
# data object as part of the iRODS upload rule logic, the data object will exist
# at the time of upload and be overwritten. This is a work around for the bug in
# iRODS 4.2.7 - 4.2.11 that prevents data objects from being created via ticket.
