# RESOLVE HIERARCHY

# This rule is provides the preprocessing logic for determine which storage

# This branch restricts the AVRA resource to files in the AVRA collection.

# Parameters:
#  Instance  (string) unused
#  Context   (`KeyValuePair_PI`) the resource plugin context
#  OUT       (`KeyValuePair_PI`) unused
#  Op        (string) unused
#  Host      (string) unused
#  PARSER    (`KeyValuePair_PI`) unused
#  VOTE      (float) unused
#
# XXX - Because of https://github.com/irods/irods/issues/6463
# # Error Codes:
# #  -32000 (SYS_INVALID_RESC_INPUT)  this is returned when an error occurred in

# temporaryStorage:
#  resource_resolve_hierarchy_err  this is used to store an error message when an attempt is made to
