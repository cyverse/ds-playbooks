# testing

This folder contains the test harness for the DS playbooks. It consists of a simplified Data Store and a playbook runner.

__TODO__ Multiple testing environments need to be created for different situations.

## The Environment

The environment consists of seven containers. The `amqp_centos` container hosts the RabbitMQ broker running on CentOS 7, and the `ampq_ubuntu` container hosts a RabbitMQ borker running on Ubuntu 22.04 that in turn hosts the `irods` exchange, where the Data Store publishes messages to. The `dbms_configured` container hosts the PostgreSQL server that in turn hosts the ICAT DB. The `proxy` container hosts HAProxy, The `provider_configured` container hosts a configured iRODS catalog service provider. The `provider_unconfigured` container hosts an unconfigured service provider. The `consumer_configured_centos` container hosts a configured CentOS catalog service consumer acting as a resource server. The `consumer_configured_ubuntu` container hosts a configured Ubuntu catalog service consumer acting as a resource server. Finally, the `consumer_unconfigured` container hosts an unconfigured service consumer.

## Building the Harness

There are two convenience scripts for building the docker images for the environment. `build` builds all the required images, and `clean` deletes them.

## Testing

`run` is a convenience script for running a playbook against the test environment. This script will bring up the environment, run the playbook and any tests, and then tear down the environment. It performs the tests in the following order.

1. It performs a syntax checkout on the playbook under test.
1. It runs the playbook on the testing inventory.
1. If there are any tests of the playbook, it runs those tests.
1. It performs an idempotency check of the playbook.

Tests can be defined for a given playbook. They should be placed in a playbook with the same name inside a `tests` folder that is in the same folder as the playbook under test.
